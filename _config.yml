  I'm a Software Developer and Open Source Supporter. Apart from being geek, I love to read
  books, and watch movies & TV shows. 
  
  Watching Artificial Intelligence evolve in movies from Star Wars to Wall-e, I got
  inclined towards <mark>Artificial Intelligence</mark> and <mark>Computer Vision</mark> .

  of delegation in order to support growth.
